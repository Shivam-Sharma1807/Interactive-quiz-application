The Quiz App is a simple, interactive web-based application designed to provide users with a timed multiple-choice quiz experience. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this application allows users to initiate a quiz session, view one question at a time, and select their answers through dynamically generated buttons. A timer tracks the duration of the quiz, adding an element of urgency and gamification.

The application's user interface is clean and minimal, featuring:

A Start Quiz button to begin the quiz.

A question container that dynamically displays the current question and its options.

A timer to display the remaining time for the quiz.

This project is ideal for learning front-end development concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic content rendering using JavaScript.
